# ITS ETL Pipeline

This project is designed to teach Python skills while developing a real-world application.

We will create:

- A world simulation that will represent the world: cities, roads, cars and events
- ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) device simulators that will generate data based on the world simulation
- A simple ATMS (Advanced Traffic Management System) that will process the data generated by the ITS devices and put it into databases and message queues
- A web client interface to the ATMS to configure ITS devices and view thier statuses
- ETL services that will connect to the ATMS to get the data and perform analysis and visualizations

Future Ideas:

- Automated CI/CD so simulation can be upgraded with no downtime
